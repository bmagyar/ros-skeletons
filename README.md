ros-skeletons
=============

The package "skeletons" contains skeletons of ROS packages.
The tools folder contains proposed ROS tools to use these skeletons in a ROS-fashion.

The idea is to have something that's like roscreate-pkg but accepts skeleton names and simply makes a copy of the skeleton while making the necessary refactoring on them.

Should also support adding license info at the beginning of files.
